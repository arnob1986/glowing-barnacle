# STILL THEY BELIEVE 
The conquerors arrived with heavy boots,

Claiming they’d bring the tools to till the soil.

They dug the mines and pulled up all the roots,

While locals gave their lives in honest toil.

The promised schools were never built at all,

Yet still they bowed and waited for the call.


The office lights stay on past eight o'clock,

Where tired men trade sleep for rising debt.

They watch the digits climb upon the stock,

While falling through a wide and fraying net.

The bonus goes to those who hold the pen,

But "work harder" is the hope of common men.


The banners wave with promises of gold,

Of silver roads and hunger cast aside.

But once the final ballot has been cast,

The masters turn their faces, filled with pride.

The ink is dry, the voices fade to black,

While voters wait for help that won't come back.


The forest falls to feed the furnace fire,

The silent beast is hounded from its home.

We take the life that nature did inspire,

And leave a desert where the rivers foam.

Though earth provides the breath and fruit we need,

She bears the scars of our ungrateful greed.


No hand will reach to pull us from the knee;
The only ones to setus firm are we.
